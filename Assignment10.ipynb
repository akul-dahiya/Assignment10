    "Q1. What is multithreading in python? why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.Multithreading refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single Python process. A thread is the smallest unit of a CPU's execution, and multithreading allows your Python program to perform multiple tasks concurrently, making better use of available resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides a built-in module called threading to handle threads. The threading module allows you to create, manage, and synchronize threads within your Python programs. It abstracts the underlying operating system thread management and provides a high-level interface for working with threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is Used:\n",
    "\n",
    " Multithreading can be used to create responsive user interfaces, ensuring that the application remains interactive even when performing CPU-bound tasks. It allows you to parallelize tasks, taking advantage of multi-core processors, and potentially speeding up CPU-intensive operations. Multithreading is useful for handling concurrent tasks, such as serving multiple clients simultaneously in a server application. Threads within the same process can share data and resources easily, making it useful for certain types of data processing."

    "Multithreading can lead to improved performance, especially on multi-core processors, as it allows the execution of multiple tasks concurrently.\n",
    "This is particularly beneficial for CPU-bound tasks that can be parallelized.\n",
    "\n",
    "It ensures that long-running tasks don't block the main program's responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads within the same process can easily share data and resources, which can simplify the design of certain applications.\n",
    "Sharing data among threads is more efficient than inter-process communication (IPC) used in multiprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context switching between threads is typically more efficient than switching between processes in multiprocessing since threads share the same memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreaded code can be complex and difficult to design, implement, and debug. It introduces synchronization issues and potential race conditions.\n",
    "Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging due to non-deterministic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "When multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, synchronization mechanisms like locks, semaphores, and conditions are needed to prevent data conflicts and race conditions.\n",
    "This synchronization overhead can reduce the performance gain from multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging multithreaded programs can be challenging because issues like race conditions may not be easily reproducible or predictable.\n",
